# Product Philosophy: AI Where It Matters

My approach to building AI products is rooted in discipline, reusability, and business impact.

## 1. Start with the user's blocker, not the technology
I don't ask "what can AI do?"—I ask "what's stopping this user right now?" A technician on a rooftop can't type, so I build voice-first. An executive won't fund what they can't measure, so I lead with ROI. The best products dissolve constraints users didn't know they had.

## 2. Prioritize ruthlessly, then earn the buy-in
Strategy isn't what you build. It's what you don't build. I use a weighted prioritization methodology—evaluating Internal Demand, Rinse & Repeat potential, Customer Impact, Strategic Fit, and Feasibility—to distill hundreds of opportunities into a few high-conviction bets.

## 3. Build platforms, not projects
Projects solve problems once. Platforms solve them forever. I architect for reusability—shared services for ingestion, orchestration, and guardrails—ensuring that each subsequent AI deployment is faster and more cost-effective.

## 4. Measure what matters when AI fails
Accuracy is table stakes. I build evaluation frameworks that weight consequences—because a hallucination in a legal document costs significantly more than a typo in a menu. I design for high-reliability via human-in-the-loop workflows.
